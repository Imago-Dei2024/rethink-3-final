              Spravato (esketamine) is a prescription nasal spray medication administered under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Approved by the FDA in 2019, it represents a significant advancement in treating depression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional oral antidepressants that primarily target serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, Spravato works on the glutamate system in the brain as an NMDA receptor antagonist. This unique mechanism makes it effective for many patients who haven&apos;t responded adequately to conventional antidepressant treatments.

              How Spravato Works
            </h2>
          </div>
          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-4xl mx-auto text-gray-600">
            <p>
              Spravato acts differently from traditional antidepressants by targeting the glutamate neurotransmitter system rather than just serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine systems. As an NMDA receptor antagonist, it helps restore synaptic connections in brain cells involved in mood regulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This novel mechanism of action can lead to rapid symptom improvement, often within hours or days, compared to conventional antidepressants that may take weeks to show benefits. This rapid response can be particularly valuable for patients experiencing severe depression symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>
              While scientists are still studying its complete mechanisms, research suggests Spravato promotes neuroplasticity - the brain&apos;s ability to form new neural connections and adapt - which may help overcome the neural pathway disruptions associated with treatment-resistant depression.

              Spravato is specifically indicated for adults with:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) - defined as depression that hasn&apos;t improved after trying at least two different antidepressant treatments</li>
              <li>Major depressive disorder (MDD) with suicidal thoughts or behaviors (used alongside an oral antidepressant)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Candidates for Spravato treatment are typically patients who:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Continue to struggle with depression symptoms despite trying multiple antidepressant medications</li>
              <li>Experience significant functional impairment due to their depression</li>
              <li>Are looking for potentially faster symptom relief than conventional antidepressants can provide</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Not everyone with depression is a suitable candidate for Spravato. A thorough evaluation by our healthcare providers will help determine if this treatment is appropriate for your specific situation.

              Spravato treatment at ReThink Mental Health follows a carefully structured process to ensure both safety and effectiveness:
            </p>
            <h3>Initial Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
              Before beginning treatment, you&apos;ll undergo a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to determine if Spravato is appropriate for your condition.
            </p>
            <h3>Treatment Setting</h3>
            <p>
              All Spravato treatment sessions take place in our REMS-certified healthcare facility under direct medical supervision. You cannot self-administer Spravato at home.
            </p>
            <h3>Treatment Schedule</h3>
            <p>
              A typical Spravato treatment plan includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Induction Phase:</strong> Two sessions per week for the first 4 weeks</li>
              <li><strong>Maintenance Phase:</strong> Once weekly for weeks 5-8, then once weekly or once every two weeks for week 9 and beyond, based on your response</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Session Structure</h3>
            <p>
              Each session follows this pattern:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Pre-treatment assessment of blood pressure and mental status</li>
              <li>Self-administration of the nasal spray under provider supervision</li>
              <li>Post-administration monitoring period of at least 2 hours</li>
              <li>Final assessment to ensure you&apos;re ready to leave safely</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Due to potential drowsiness and dissociation, you must not drive or operate machinery on the day of treatment. You&apos;ll need to arrange transportation home after each session.

                &quot;After trying multiple antidepressants over 15 years with minimal relief, I felt hopeless. Within my first few Spravato treatments, I noticed a significant lifting of my depression. The dissociation experience during treatment was strange at first, but the staff was so supportive. For the first time in years, I feel like I can move forward with my life.&quot;

                &quot;I was skeptical about Spravato after so many failed treatments. The first sessions were challengingâI experienced some dizziness and felt disconnected. But by week three, I noticed I was sleeping better and had more energy. Six months in, I&apos;m maintaining with biweekly treatments. It wasn&apos;t a miracle cure, but it gave me back enough functionality to benefit from therapy and rebuild my life.&quot;

                <p>
                  Unlike traditional antidepressants that may take weeks to show effects, many patients report feeling improvement within hours or days after their first Spravato treatments. However, the full benefits typically develop over the course of several weeks of consistent treatment.

                <p>
                  Many insurance plans, including Medicare and commercial insurance, now cover Spravato for eligible patients with treatment-resistant depression. Coverage typically requires documentation of previous treatment failures. Our team can help verify your benefits and navigate the authorization process.

                  Many patients experience a temporary dissociative state during treatmentâfeeling detached from their surroundings or experiencing perceptual changes. This typically resolves within 1-2 hours. Other common experiences include feeling relaxed, sedated, or experiencing mild dizziness. Our team provides a comfortable, supportive environment and monitors you throughout the experience.

                <p>
                  Treatment duration varies based on individual response. The initial intensive phase lasts 4 weeks with twice-weekly sessions. After that, treatment typically continues with weekly or biweekly sessions for maintenance. Some patients benefit from long-term maintenance treatment, while others may eventually taper off. Our providers work with you to determine the optimal treatment schedule based on your response and needs.

                <p>
                  Yes. Spravato is designed to be used in conjunction with an oral antidepressant, not as a replacement. The combination of Spravato and an oral antidepressant provides more comprehensive treatment for depression symptoms.
